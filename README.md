# Open Source Python
This repository contains a compilation of resources that you can use to learn Python 3. Completely online, completely free. Please keep in mind that none of these resources are *mine*. Its also important to note that the some of the courses are paid, but are *free* to audit. 

## Courses:
Please note that you don't have to follow the prerequisites and the order of the courses. You can check the actual course for the recommended prerequisities.
